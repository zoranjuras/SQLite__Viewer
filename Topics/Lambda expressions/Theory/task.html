<h2>Lambda expressions</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you already know, Java is primarily an object-oriented programming language. It supports classes, methods, fields, and other concepts from this paradigm. Methods are the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the main method is the entry point of a Java application and the starting point for program execution. | It's a special method that acts as a gateway to the world of Java programming. The main method should be present in every Java application, even in the simplest procedural-style programs. It's declared as a public, static, void method and takes an array of strings as an argument, which represents command-line arguments. The main method is significant because it's the starting point for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to begin executing the application's code. When the JVM encounters the main method, it creates an instance of the class containing the main method and calls it. From there, the program can create and interact with objects, call methods, and perform other tasks. Additionally, the main method can be used to start new threads, which are separate paths of execution within a program. This allows for the creation of concurrent tasks and can improve the performance of complex applications.">main</a> way to represent the behavior of objects, classes, and whole programs. You can write absolutely any code inside their bodies and then invoke this code from other parts of your program using the names of the methods. This approach allows developers to create very structured and well-readable programs, but sometimes it's not enough and we should use other ways to represent behavior rather than methods.</p>
<h5 id="functional-programming-in-java">Functional programming in Java</h5>
<p>This topic begins to explain another programming paradigm called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10570" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, functional decomposition refers to the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable functions or methods. | Each method performs a specific task, and these methods can be executed in a sequence to obtain the desired result. When approaching a problem, it is important to identify actions that may need to be repeated or performed separately. This process of functional decomposition results in methods that are easier to read, understand, reuse, test, and debug.">functional</a> programming (FP)</strong> that uses <strong>functions</strong> as the primary concept to provide an alternative way to solve many programming challenges. Like methods, functions are used to decompose code into small pieces. However, unlike methods, functions can also behave like regular Java objects (e.g., be passed to/returned from a method).</p>
<p>Of course, it is impossible to explain the whole paradigm at once, so there will be a lot of engaging topics. The first concept we will learn is <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a lambda expression is a function that is not bound to a name (an anonymous function) and can be assigned to a variable. | It consists of a list of parameters followed by the body that can return a value. Lambda expressions are often used to pass a block of code as data to a method. They allow for more readable and concise code, and can be used in place of method references. Lambda expressions have a special type, and there are several types of lambda expressions defined in the Java standard library, such as Function and Predicate, both located in the java.util.function package.">lambda expressions</a></strong> which is the closest one to the standard Java methods. Let's take a look at what they are and why we use them.</p>
<h5 id="lambda-expressions">Lambda expressions</h5>
<p>By <strong>a</strong> <strong>lambda expression</strong> (or just "a lambda"), we mean a <strong>function</strong> that isn't bound to its name (an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11896" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an anonymous class is a class that is declared and instantiated in a single statement without a name identifier. | It is useful when you need to use a class that overrides some methods of another class or interface only once. An anonymous class always implements an interface or extends another class (concrete or abstract). The syntax of an anonymous class is similar to a constructor call, except that it contains a class definition in a block of code. Anonymous classes are often used to create callbacks, which are pieces of executable code that are passed to another code as an argument and executed at a convenient time.">anonymous</a> function) but can be <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, assignment is the action of assigning a value or the result of an expression to a variable. | This is done using the assignment operator, denoted by =. Initialization, on the other hand, refers to the process of assigning an initial value or the result of an expression to a variable at the time of its declaration. Proper initialization is important in Java as it ensures that objects are set up correctly before they are used in the program.">assigned</a> to a variable.</p>
<p>The most general form of a lambda expression looks like this: <code class="language-java">(parameters) -&gt; { body };</code>. Here, the part before <code class="language-java">-&gt;</code> is the list of parameters (like in methods), and the part after that is the body that can return a value. The brackets <code class="language-java">{ }</code> are required only for multi-line lambda expressions.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Sometimes, lambdas don't have parameters or return values or even both. Even if a lambda doesn't have a value to return, it has a body that does some useful actions (e.g. prints or saves something). You will encounter practical examples with such lambdas in the following topics.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Another important thing â€” like a regular Java object, a lambda expression always has a special type. There are a lot of types presented in the Java Standard Library. In this topic, we will only mention two of them: <code class="language-java">Function</code> and <code class="language-java">BiFunction</code>. Both of the classes are located in the <code class="language-java">java.util.function</code> package among others.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>You don't need to find and remember all possible types of lambda expressions at once. You will gradually do this as you learn.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Let's consider a single-line lambda expression that just checks whether the first number is divisible by the second one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Boolean&gt; isDivisible = (x, y) -&gt; x % y == 0;</code></pre>
<p>The expression has the type <code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;Integer, Integer, Boolean&gt;</code> which means, that it takes two <code class="language-java">Integer</code> values and returns a <code class="language-java">Boolean</code> value.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to write lambda expressions. Let's consider more examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// if it has only one argument "()" are optional
Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; adder1 = x -&gt; x + 1;

// with type inference
Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; mult2 = (Integer x) -&gt; x * 2;

// with multiple statements
Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; adder5 = (x) -&gt; {
    x += 2;
    x += 3;
    return x;
};</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Although Java provides a lot of ways to write lambda expressions, you always need to choose the shortest and most readable way to do this.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="invoking-lambda-expressions">Invoking lambda expressions</h5>
<p>Once a lambda expression is created, it can be used in other places of your program like a regular Java object. You can invoke the body of an expression using special methods like <code class="language-java">apply</code> as many times as you need. The name of the method depends on the type of lambda expression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean result4Div2 = isDivisible.apply(4, 2); // true
boolean result3Div5 = isDivisible.apply(3, 5); // false</code></pre>
<p>So, we can invoke a lambda expression like a regular method passing arguments and obtaining results!</p>
<h5 id="passing-lambda-expressions-to-methods">Passing lambda expressions to methods</h5>
<p>One of the most popular cases is to pass a lambda expression to a method and then call it there.</p>
<p>Look at the method below. It takes an object of the standard generic <code class="language-java">Function</code> type. </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">private static void printResultOfLambda(Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; function) {
    System.out.println(function.apply("HAPPY NEW YEAR 3000!"));
}</code></pre>
<p>This function can take a <code class="language-java">String</code> argument and return an <code class="language-java">Integer</code> result. To test the method, let's create an object and pass it into the method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// it returns the length of a string
Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; f = s -&gt; s.length();
printResultOfLambda(f); // it prints 20
</code></pre>
<p>You can also pass a lambda expression to the method directly without an intermediate reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// passing without a reference
printResultOfLambda(s -&gt; s.length()); // the result is the same: 20</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can present our function as an object and pass it to a method as its argument, if the method takes an object of that type. Then, inside the method, the given function will be invoked.</p>
<p>But why do we need it? First, let's look at another example, which uses a more complex lambda expression and calculates the number of digits in the string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// It prints the number of digits: 4
printResultOfLambda(s -&gt; {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
});</code></pre>
<p>What is important here? We do not pass data to the <code class="language-java">printResultOfLambda</code>, but rather some piece of code as data. So, we can parameterize the same method with a different behavior at runtime. This is what typical uses of lambda expressions look like. Many standard methods can accept lambda expressions. This will be discussed in more detail in the following topics.</p>
<p>Let's introduce an important term according to the examples. In functional programming theory, a function that accepts or returns another function is called a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a higher-order function is a function or method that accepts or returns another function or method as a parameter or result. | This concept is an essential part of functional programming, where functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned as values, or assigned to variables. In the context of Java, higher-order functions can be implemented using functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. These interfaces can be used as types for lambda expressions, allowing for the creation of higher-order functions. For example, a higher-order function in Java could be a method that accepts a function as an argument and returns a new function that combines the behavior of the original function with some additional behavior. This technique is known as function composition and is a powerful tool for creating more complex functions from simpler ones.">higher-order function</a></strong>. In terms of Java, we're talking about methods or functions which take / return <code class="language-java">Function&lt;T, R&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">BiFunction&lt;T, U, R&gt;</code> or other types we will consider soon.</p>
<h5 id="closures">Closures</h5>
<p>Another important trick with lambda expressions is the possibility to capture values from a context where the lambda is defined and use the values within the body. This technique is called <strong>closure</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Capturing is possible only if a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11896" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a context variable refers to a local variable or a final variable that is accessible within an anonymous class or a lambda expression. | These variables are captured and can be used within the body of the anonymous class or lambda expression, even if they are not explicitly passed as parameters. This feature allows for the creation of compact, self-contained classes that can encapsulate behavior and be easily passed around in an application or library.">context variable</a> has the <code class="language-java">final</code> keyword or it's <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an effectively final variable is a variable that is not declared with the final keyword, but is assigned only once and never changed after that. | This concept is related to the use of lambda expressions in Java, where only effectively final variables can be captured and used within the lambda body. This is because lambda expressions are designed to be immutable and side-effect free, and using effectively final variables helps ensure this behavior. However, the use of the final keyword is not always necessary or desirable, as it can lead to increased boilerplate code and reduced readability.">effectively final</a></strong>, i.e. the variable isn't changed in further code. Otherwise, an error happens.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">final String hello = "Hello, ";
Function&lt;String, String&gt; helloFunction = (name) -&gt; hello + name;

System.out.println(helloFunction.apply("John"));
System.out.println(helloFunction.apply("Anastasia"));
</code></pre>
<p>The lambda expression captured the final variable <code class="language-java">hello</code>.</p>
<p>The result of this code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Hello, John
Hello, Anastasia
</code></pre>
<p>Let's consider an example with an effective <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7427" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a final variable is a variable that is declared with the final keyword and cannot be modified once it has been initialized. | Final variables can be of any data type, including primitive types and reference types. They are typically used for values that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program. Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned. However, if the final variable is a reference type, the state of the object it references can still be modified, as long as the reference itself remains unchanged. If a final variable is not initialized at the time of declaration, it must be assigned a value in a constructor of the class.">final variable</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int constant = 100;
Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; adder100 = x -&gt; x + constant;

System.out.println(adder100.apply(200)); // 300
System.out.println(adder100.apply(300)); // 400
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code class="language-java">constant</code> is effectively final and is captured by the lambda expression.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, you started learning a new programming paradigm. You've seen the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, syntax refers to a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid. | It includes the order of components, such as statements written from top to bottom in a sequential manner, and the use of specific symbols, such as semicolons to terminate a statement.
